# noobscripts
Recon script to automate your reconnaissance and find interesting stuff on domains/sub-domains of a website ;)

This is a heavy tool and it's not maintained anymore. Use it at your own risk.

P.S: This script was made as a part of recon methodology for bug bounty hunting.



## Usage 

`sh noobscripts.sh -d https://example.com`
